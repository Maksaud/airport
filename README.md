## Abstraction
Making code more simpler to understand by:
- documentation
- seperation of concerns
- inheritance
## encapsulation
Making items more secure by privatising attributes or methods.
Privatasing is important because there is a restriction of
access to from external functions and methods.

Getter and Setter methods are used for privatisation.
## inheritance
This allows child classes take in attributes or methods from parent classes

## DRY
Do-Not
Repeat
Yourself
This is to ensure that there is no reduntant actions such as constantly repeating
code when they can be reduced by functions and arguments from methods and functions.
## Control flow

## Seperation of concerns
## dod
When all conditions of the acceptance criterea is complete
- working code
- readme.md
- git
- github
